# ConfigMgr Remote Compliance
**ConfigMgr Remote Compliance** can be used to view, evaluate and report on **System Center Configuration Manager Compliance Baselines** on a **remote computer**. It provides similar functionality to the Configurations tab of the Configuration Manager Control Panel, but for remote computers. It is a useful troubleshooting tool for remotely viewing client compliance, evaluating baselines, viewing the evaluation report or opening DCM log files from the client, without needing to access the target computer directly.
